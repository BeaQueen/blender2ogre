Upgrading?
	. if you are upgrading from a previous version of blender2ogre, and having problems, you may want to delete your old .cfg file:
		example linux: rm ~/.blender/2.58/config/scripts/blender2ogre.cfg

Getting Started:
	. After installing the addon (see below), enable it from "User Preferences->Add-Ons->Import-Export"
	. Integrated help docs will be shown in the upper right hand toolbar, replacing blender's normal 'Help' menu, read them!

Installing:
	Installing the Addon:
		. You can simply copy io_export_ogreDotScene.py to your blender installation under blender/2.58/scripts/addons_contrib/
		. Or you can use blenders interface, under user-prefs, click addons, click 'install-addon', and select: io_export_ogreDotScene.py

	Installing Dependencies:
		Linux:
			1. Get the Ogre source code, compile and "make install" that should give you: /usr/local/bin/OgreXMLConverter
			2. Get Ogre Meshy for Windows, install wine, extract OgreMeshy to /home/yourname/OgreMeshy

		Windows:
			1. extract the zip "blender2ogre-minimal-deps(win32,wine).zip"
			2. install OgreCommandLineTools_1.6.3.msi and msvcpp_2008_sp1_redist_vcredist_x86.exe
			3. copy OgreMeshy to C:\

		Get the latest Ogre Meshy from: http://sourceforge.net/projects/ogremeshy/


Installing OSX - by Night Elf:
    Compile OgreXMLConverter from source, and "make install"
    "So, apparently OgreXMLConverter wasn't working because it couldn't find Ogre.framework. 
    I got it working now. So, in case someone's having a similar problem, here's how to get this exporter working on OSX":

Add-on installation:
    Download the latest script
    In Blender: File > User Preferences... > Add-Ons > Install Add-On... and look for the io_export_ogreDotScene.py file
    Enable the add-on
    Ogre Command-Line Tools:
    Get the OgreMeshConverter tool by building Ogre from source or from the pre-built SDK. I built from source and it's in <Ogre Folder>/build/bin/Release.
    Copy the OgreMeshConverter file to your /usr/bin folder. It's a hidden folder, so, to do that, open Terminal and enter the following commands:
    CODE:
        cd /usr/bin
        open .
    Finder will open on the /usr/bin folder (There may be an easier way, I'm quite new to Mac OS...)
    Drag the OgreMeshConverter file over to that folder
    Ogre framework:
    Get the Ogre.framework by building Ogre form source or form the pre-built SDK. I built form soruce and it's in <Ogre Folder>/build/lib/Release. It shows like a folder.
    Copy Ogre.framework to your /Library/Frameworks folder.
