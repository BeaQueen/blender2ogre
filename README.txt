################################### OSX ########################################
Installing OSX - by Night Elf:
    Compile OgreXMLConverter from source, and "make install"
    "So, apparently OgreXMLConverter wasn't working because it couldn't find Ogre.framework. 
    I got it working now. So, in case someone's having a similar problem, here's how to get this exporter working on OSX":

Add-on installation:
    Download the latest script
    In Blender: File > User Preferences... > Add-Ons > Install Add-On... and look for the io_export_ogreDotScene.py file
    Enable the add-on
    Ogre Command-Line Tools:
    Get the OgreMeshConverter tool by building Ogre from source or from the pre-built SDK. I built from source and it's in <Ogre Folder>/build/bin/Release.
    Copy the OgreMeshConverter file to your /usr/bin folder. It's a hidden folder, so, to do that, open Terminal and enter the following commands:
    CODE:
        cd /usr/bin
        open .
    Finder will open on the /usr/bin folder (There may be an easier way, I'm quite new to Mac OS...)
    Drag the OgreMeshConverter file over to that folder
    Ogre framework:
    Get the Ogre.framework by building Ogre from source or from the pre-built SDK. I built form soruce and it's in <Ogre Folder>/build/lib/Release. It shows like a folder.
    Copy Ogre.framework to your /Library/Frameworks folder.
